                                Creativity is the power to think beyond limits, to imagine what has not been imagined, and to bring ideas to life. It is an essential force that drives innovation, solves problems, and inspires change. Whether through art, science, or everyday life, creativity allows us to see the world from new perspectives and make connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.
